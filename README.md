# SQL Data Cleaning Projects

Welcome to the SQL Data Cleaning Projects repository! This repository contains two projects where I applied advanced SQL techniques to clean and standardize datasets. These projects highlight my SQL proficiency in data preprocessing, ensuring data accuracy and consistency for data engineering and scientist roles.

## Global Layoffs Data Cleaning

**Description**: Utilized advanced SQL techniques to clean and standardize a dataset on global layoffs. Key tasks included removing duplicates, standardizing industry names and dates, and managing null values.

**Key Steps**:
1. Removed duplicates using SQL window functions.
2. Standardized industry names and date formats.
3. Handled null values to ensure data completeness.

## Nashville Housing Data Cleaning

**Description**: Applied SQL to clean and standardize the Nashville housing dataset. Key tasks included standardizing date formats, populating missing property addresses, breaking down address fields, converting boolean values, and removing duplicates.

**Key Steps**:
1. Standardized date formats for consistency.
2. Populated missing property addresses using JOINs.
3. Split address fields into individual columns (Address, City, State).
4. Converted boolean fields for clarity.
5. Removed duplicates and unnecessary columns.
